                  both
                  AAA and indie, and every single one of them deserves at least a once-over on your gaming PC.<br><br>

                  the
                  graphical heavy lifting that new GPUs like the Nvidia RTX 3080 and AMD’s Navi line are capable of, the

                  <p>World of Warcraft: Shadowlands may be the fastest selling game this side of Cyberpunk 2077. But
                    it’s also a
                    shot in the arm to one of the longest lasting MMOs out there. Considering WoW has 16 years under its
                    belt, the
                    new installment keeps things fresh by introducing not only a new story but a revamped leveling
                    system, access to
                    a new class, and, of course, new areas, dungeons, and raids to explore and take part in.<br><br>

                    World of Warcraft: Shadowlands takes place in the land of the dead, split into five major zones and
                    a central
                    hub city to explore. Whether you want to play with friends or tackle the story on your own, there’s
                    a ton of new
                    content here to keep you occupied. Though there’s plenty of new additions with the expansion, such
                    as more
                    character customizations and a new drop zone known as “Exile’s Reach” for beginner players to level
                    up, the game
                    stays true to its RPG and MMO roots, giving you the kind of fantasy-laden vast world to explore and
                    kill
                    monsters in that’s kept the game alive for 16 years.</p>

                    realize that the Microsoft Flight Simulator is a labor of love. There’s a great attention to detail
                    here, as well as a level of realism and immersion you won’t find elsewhere. So much so that if
                    you’re not a fan of flight simulations, you’ll want to start getting on the bandwagon. Though that
                    also means this game won’t be for everyone. Still, if you’re a flight sim fanatic or you love planes
                    and flying, you’ll relish the chance to fly iconic vehicles in some of the most beautiful yet

                    up the story started in 2016’s Hitman. Just like the previous games, the maps will take you all over
                    the world from Dubai and England to China and more.<br><br>

                  <p>Monster Hunter is one of the biggest gaming franchises you’ve probably never heard of for years

                    many gamers’ relief), and now, it’s one of the best PC games you can play to date.<br><br>
                    Monster Hunter: World puts you in the shoes of a monster hunter, and you’ll hunt increasingly bigger
                    and meaner monsters, strip them for parts, and craft bigger, badder armor. It’s a deviously simple
                    gameplay loop that ends up being one of the most compelling and rewarding PC games you can play

                  <p>The newest release from Rockstar Games was an instant hit upon release. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an
                    engrossing western following Arthur Morgan and his gang as they try to survive a fictionalized Wild
                    West as outlaws on the run. However, the game is much more than just that.<br><br>
                    Whether it’s getting lost in the story, following through on every side quest to its conclusion, or
                    just bonding with your horse, RDR2 is one of those games where you can easily sink 50+ hours into
                    and still have something to do. The gameplay is stellar, and the graphics are gorgeous. You can even
                    run the game in 8K, if you have the hardware. Definitely give this a look if you haven’t already.

                  <p>Doom: Eternal takes everything from the remastered Doom of 2016 and turns it up to 11. The game is
                    intense, visually and sonically overwhelming, and is exactly what you would expect a fever dream
                    inspired by Doom would feel like.<br><br>
                    The gameplay is a seamless first-person shooter where you trek into hell to battle an assortment of
                    never-ending demons and reclaim an overrun earth. Refilling your health sometimes requires quite
                    literally tearing monsters apart, and there is some need to be creative with your weapon choice,
                    depending on what demon you’re facing. However, this game is all about creating havoc and rushing
                    into battle as loud and as brash as possible.<br>
