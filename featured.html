            <p>The list of best PC games might seem endless. After all, there’s a lot of amazing titles out there both
              AAA and indie, and every single one of them deserves at least a once-over on your gaming PC.<br><br>
              However, there are those that really stand out from the crowd. The truly best PC games will let you
              experience imaginative adventures, transport you to wonderful new places, and immerse you in epic journeys
              that you’ll never visit or have otherwise. They’ll give your gaming PC and the best gaming monitors a
              proper workout, as well as really take advantage of those immersive gaming headsets. Although with all the
              graphical heavy lifting that new GPUs like the Nvidia RTX 3080 and AMD’s Navi line are capable of, the
              quality at which you can experience these games will be more impressive than ever. <br><br>
              From the best MMOs or MOBAs and the newest open-world games in which you can traverse strange and
              wonderful landscapes to the best co-op PC games in which you can compete with your closest friends, hours
              upon hours of fun await you. Here are the best PC games right now, including the best Steam games.</p>

    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-one.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>Paradise Lost is a game that will intrigue fans of alternate history. It’s set in a world where World War 2
        ended in the nuclear destruction of Europe by the Nazis. Almost 20 years after that apocalyptic event finds you,
        playing as 12-year old Szymon, exploring an abandoned Nazi bunker looking in search of a mysterious man.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/card-two.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is aging like fine wine. Even several years after it hit the streets, it’s still one
        of the most impressive open world games that’s ever existed – mixing Skyrim’s unapologetic scale with Grand
        Theft Auto V’s incredible depth. It’s such a jam-packed game, which is why it claims the top spot on our list of
        the best PC games in 2021. Staggering, beautiful and an absolute time sink – in a good way – The Witcher 3: Wild
        Hunt isn’t just the best PC game of 2021 or among the best open world games on PC. It might just be one of the
        best video games of all time.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/card-three.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>Ultra-violence and constant motion meet in this post-apocalyptic dystopian game. This FPP is not for the faint
        of heart – it’s tense, exhilarating, and you will probably die over and over trying to beat it. If you ever
        wanted a game that came in equal parts Doom Eternal and Mirror’s Edge, you found it in Ghostrunner.<br><br>
        The game is set in Dharma Tower, a sort-of last refuge for humanity, where you ascend the tower through
        platforming and katana-induced carnage to take revenge on a ruthless ruler. You do so by slicing up your
        enemies, dodging bullets, and using a number of unique abilities to continue making your way to the top. This is
        the kind of game that will leave you out of breath just playing it. And, if that sounds like your kind of game,
        then you’re in for a treat.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/card-four.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>It’s not hard to see why Control has taken the gaming world by storm. The creative team at Remedy Entertainment
        made sure to pack this title with plenty to love, paying very close attention to the intricate details. A deeply
        cinematic game, this action-adventure offers its players staggering visuals, inspired environment design and
        brilliant performances – not to mention, a deeply satisfying combat experience.<br><br>
        Control places you in the capable shoes of fiery-haired Jesse Faden. You’re tasked to seek out The Oldest House,
        a building in New York City that’s in a constant state of architectural flux and only appears to those who
        desire to find it, and locate your missing brother, all while heading the Federal Bureau of Control as its
        director and overseeing the containment of paranatural entities.<br><br>
        There’s nothing quite like Control on the market, and it makes it one of the best PC games to play right now.

      <h2>4. World of Warcraft: Shadowlands</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-five.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>World of Warcraft: Shadowlands may be the fastest selling game this side of Cyberpunk 2077. But it’s also a
        shot in the arm to one of the longest lasting MMOs out there. Considering WoW has 16 years under its belt, the
        new installment keeps things fresh by introducing not only a new story but a revamped leveling system, access to
        a new class, and, of course, new areas, dungeons, and raids to explore and take part in.<br><br>

        World of Warcraft: Shadowlands takes place in the land of the dead, split into five major zones and a central
        hub city to explore. Whether you want to play with friends or tackle the story on your own, there’s a ton of new
        content here to keep you occupied. Though there’s plenty of new additions with the expansion, such as more
        character customizations and a new drop zone known as “Exile’s Reach” for beginner players to level up, the game
        stays true to its RPG and MMO roots, giving you the kind of fantasy-laden vast world to explore and kill
        monsters in that’s kept the game alive for 16 years.</p>

      <h2>5. Microsoft Flight Simulator</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-six.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>Beyond its impeccable graphics and its excellent peripheral support, it won’t take you long to realize that the Microsoft Flight Simulator is a labor of love. There’s a great attention to detail here, as well as a level of realism and immersion you won’t find elsewhere. So much so that if you’re not a fan of flight simulations, you’ll want to start getting on the bandwagon. Though that also means this game won’t be for everyone. Still, if you’re a flight sim fanatic or you love planes and flying, you’ll relish the chance to fly iconic vehicles in some of the most beautiful yet dangerous locations and conditions in the world.</p>

      <h2>6. Hitman 3</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-seven.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>Hitman 3 closes out the rebooted trilogy with another gorgeous entry that hews close to what makes these games so unique. It doesn’t redefine the gameplay but it does introduce six new maps and wraps up the story started in 2016’s Hitman. Just like the previous games, the maps will take you all over the world from Dubai and England to China and more.<br><br>
        If you’re not familiar with the gameplay of this series, you’re in for a treat. As Agent 47, you play a calm and calculating hitman whose job is not to run and gun through a mob of bad guys as most games would have you do. Instead, you move around large maps like an English manor to find and eliminate your targets quietly and undetected. On top of that, you can play the same map multiple times to find a multitude of ways or story paths to take out your targets, giving this entry, as well as the previous ones, the kind of replayability you don’t see in most games.</p>

      <h2>7. Monster Hunter World</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-eight.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>Monster Hunter is one of the biggest gaming franchises you’ve probably never heard of for years now. With Monster Hunter: World, the series broke into the mainstream and came to the PC (much to many gamers’ relief), and now, it’s one of the best PC games you can play to date.<br><br>
        Monster Hunter: World puts you in the shoes of a monster hunter, and you’ll hunt increasingly bigger and meaner monsters, strip them for parts, and craft bigger, badder armor. It’s a deviously simple gameplay loop that ends up being one of the most compelling and rewarding PC games you can play right now. <br><br>
        There’s an incessant onslaught of content in this game, and Capcom, the developers of this monster hunting hit, are committed to bringing a wealth of free DLC to the game – as well as a new frosty expansion in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. If you’re looking for an addictive, immersive and most importantly, fun game to play on your own or with all your closest friends cooperatively, Monster Hunter: World is the PC game of your dreams. There’s no doubt it’s one of the best PC games you can buy today.</p>

      <h2>8. Death Stranding</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-nine.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>If the name Norman Reedus is what got your attention when someone mentioned Death Stranding, well then you’re in for a treat. However, this game is getting a lot of attention for more than just the big names attached to it, which incidentally include Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux. As porter Sam Bridges, you bravely traverse an apocalyptic United States to deliver valuable cargo, navigating lands overrun by terrorists, bandits and these invisible creatures called Beached Things. This award-winning action game is a treat to all the senses as well, thanks to its great storyline, which may be reminiscent of the current pandemic, good gameplay, fun quests, and impressive sound and visuals. </p>

      <h2>9. Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-ten.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>The newest release from Rockstar Games was an instant hit upon release. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an engrossing western following Arthur Morgan and his gang as they try to survive a fictionalized Wild West as outlaws on the run. However, the game is much more than just that.<br><br>
        Whether it’s getting lost in the story, following through on every side quest to its conclusion, or just bonding with your horse, RDR2 is one of those games where you can easily sink 50+ hours into and still have something to do. The gameplay is stellar, and the graphics are gorgeous. You can even run the game in 8K, if you have the hardware. Definitely give this a look if you haven’t already.</p>

      <h2>10. Doom: Eternal</h2>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/images/card-eleven.jpg" class="card-image" alt="">
    <div class="card-description">
      <p>Doom: Eternal takes everything from the remastered Doom of 2016 and turns it up to 11. The game is intense, visually and sonically overwhelming, and is exactly what you would expect a fever dream inspired by Doom would feel like.<br><br>
        The gameplay is a seamless first-person shooter where you trek into hell to battle an assortment of never-ending demons and reclaim an overrun earth. Refilling your health sometimes requires quite literally tearing monsters apart, and there is some need to be creative with your weapon choice, depending on what demon you’re facing. However, this game is all about creating havoc and rushing into battle as loud and as brash as possible.<br><br>
        Not only is Doom: Eternal a hell of a ride (pun intended). It’s also a gorgeous looking game that takes advantage of the newest hardware. And, it’s a 2v1 multiplayer mode where one player takes control of the “slayer” and faces off against two more player-controlled demons.</p>
